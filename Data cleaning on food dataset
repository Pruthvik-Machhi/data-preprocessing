missing values\n\n1. **Complete Case Analysis (CCA)**:\n   - In complete case analysis, also known as listwise deletion, you simply remove any observations from your dataset that contain missing values in any of the columns.\n   - This method is straightforward and easy to implement.\n   - However, it can lead to loss of valuable information, especially if the missing values are not missing completely at random (MCAR).\n\n2. **Pairwise Deletion**:\n   - With pairwise deletion, also known as available case analysis, you retain observations with missing values for specific analyses but only use the available data for each calculation.\n   - This method allows you to maximize the use of available data without discarding entire observations.\n   - However, it can lead to biased estimates if missingness is related to the variables being analyzed.\n\n3. **Threshold-based Removal**:\n   - In threshold-based removal, you set a threshold for the proportion of missing values allowed in each observation or column. Observations or columns exceeding this threshold are removed from the dataset.\n   - This method allows you to control the extent of data loss by adjusting the threshold.\n   - However, choosing an appropriate threshold can be subjective and may require domain knowledge or sensitivity analysis.\n\n4. **Column-wise Removal**:\n   - If certain columns in your dataset have a high proportion of missing values and are not critical for your analysis, you may choose to remove those columns entirely.\n   - This method can help reduce the complexity of your dataset and focus your analysis on the most informative variables.\n   - However, it may result in the loss of potentially relevant information, so it's essential to carefully evaluate the importance of each column.\n\n5. **Row-wise Removal**:\n   - Similarly, if certain observations have missing values across multiple columns and cannot be imputed accurately, you may choose to remove those observations entirely.\n   - This method can help ensure the quality of your dataset by eliminating potentially unreliable or biased observations.\n   - However, it may reduce the sample size and statistical power of your analysis, particularly if missingness is non-random.\n\n6. **Imputation before removal**:\n   - Before removing missing values, you may consider imputing missing values for certain columns to retain as much information as possible.\n   - After imputation, you can then apply one of the aforementioned methods to remove remaining missing values or observations.\n   - This approach allows you to balance the trade-off between data completeness and bias reduction.\n\nHere dataset size  is small (125 rows), and considering the potential loss of valuable information,we can use the following approaches:\n\n1. **Imputation before removal**: Since you have a small dataset, imputing missing values before removing them might be beneficial. You can use appropriate imputation methods (e.g., mean, median, mode imputation for numerical or categorical variables) to fill in missing values, thereby retaining as much information as possible.\n\n2. **Threshold-based Removal**: Considering the small number of observations, you might set a relatively lenient threshold for removing observations or columns with missing values. This approach allows you to control the extent of data loss while ensuring that the remaining dataset is relatively complete.\n\nCombining these approaches can help mitigate the loss of information while still addressing the issue of missing values. Here's how you might proceed:\n\n- **Impute missing values**: Use imputation methods to fill in missing values in your dataset.\n- **Threshold-based removal**: After imputation, apply a threshold-based approach to remove any remaining observations or columns with a high proportion of missing values.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"numeric_columns = []\nfor column
